# Connect4

My code is a simple version of Connectfour with a 2d array board.
My idea was to create a board of chars to keep track of the players 'R' and 'B'.
However, I was not able to figure out my main. I wanted it to contain a while loop looping though each players turn
I spent too much time trying to get the methods in my board class to work.
